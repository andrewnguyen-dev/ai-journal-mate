## Getting Started

- Clone the repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/andrewnguyen-dev/ai-journal-mate.git
  cd ai-journal-mate
  ```

- Install dependencies:

  If you are using npm:
  
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

## Environment Variables
Create a .env and .env.local file in the root directory of the project and add the variables (contact Andrew for this).

## Database Setup
Since the database is shared, the schema and data are already in place. (I'm not sure about this)

If you want to inspect the database:
```bash
npx prisma studio
```

## Running the Project
Once you have everything set up, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
