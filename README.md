## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
cd yourprojectname
```

2. Install dependencies:

If you are using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Environment Variables
Create a .env and .env.local file in the root directory of the project and add the variables (contact Andrew for this).

## Database Setup
Since the database is shared, the schema and data are already in place. (I'm not sure about this)

## Running the Project
Once you have everything set up, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
